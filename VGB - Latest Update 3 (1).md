## **1.2 PROPOSED DATABASE APPLICATION**

### **Brief Description**

The Video Game Bulletin (VGB) database application is a web-based platform designed to centralize video game release information. The system uses Firebase (Realtime Database and Firestore) to store and manage data about games (including cover images), users, reviews with ratings, and user favorites. The database supports real-time updates, allowing users to access the most current information about game releases, platforms, genres, visual content, and community reviews. The application features advanced search and filtering capabilities, enabling users to find games by multiple criteria including title, platform, release date, status, genre, and user ratings.

### **Scope and Boundaries**

The application's scope includes a release calendar with game images, search and filtering tools, game detail pages with cover images, reviews and ratings, and user interaction functionalities. Key features include account creation, favoriting games, and a comprehensive review and rating system. The database's boundaries are defined by the data it stores and manages, which includes information on games (with integrated platform, genre, and image data), release dates, user profiles, reviews with ratings, and favorites.

### **Key Features:**

* **Visual Game Display:** Game cover images displayed throughout the platform (calendar, search results, detail pages)  
* **Advanced Search and Filtering Tools:** Users can search by title or keywords and apply multiple filters simultaneously  
* **Filter by Platform:** Narrow results to specific gaming platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, etc.)  
* **Filter by Genre:** Find games by genre categories (Action, RPG, Strategy, Horror, Racing, Adventure, etc.)  
* **Filter by Status:** View only upcoming or already released games  
* **Filter by Release Date:** Find games within specific date ranges  
* **Filter by User Rating:** View games sorted by average user rating  
* **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Combine multiple filters for precise game discovery (e.g., PS5 \+ Action genre \+ upcoming \+ highly rated)  
* **Review and Rating System:** Users can write text reviews, provide star ratings (1-5), or both

### **Major Application Areas and User Groups**

#### **Major Application Areas**

The system's main functionalities are divided into three areas:

1. **User-Facing Information and Discovery:** This includes the display of a real-time release calendar with game images, an advanced search and filtering system for finding games by multiple criteria (title, keywords, platform, genre, status, release date, rating), and a detailed view for individual game information with cover images, reviews and ratings.

2. **Interactive User Features:** This covers user account creation, login, favoriting games, and the review and rating system.

3. **Administrative Content Management:** This area includes specialized tools exclusively for managing, updating, and monitoring the game information database (adding, updating, and removing game information with platform, genre, and image data), and moderating reviews by viewing and removing user reviews.

#### **User Groups**

**Guest Users (General Public):** Individuals who browse the site to check releases for games, search and filter games by various criteria (platform, genre, status, date range, rating), view game details (platform, genre, description, cover image), and **read reviews and ratings** without needing an account. They can also create an account to access interactive features.

**Registered Users:** Individuals with an account who can perform all actions available to Guest Users, plus log in, favorite games, and **write reviews and provide ratings** on games.

**Administrator/Content Manager:** Specialized role exclusively responsible for **administrative content management**. This includes monitoring databases, ensuring the accuracy of game information by adding, updating, and removing game information (including platform, genre, and image data), and **moderating reviews** by viewing all registered users' reviews and removing inappropriate, spam, or any user reviews as needed. Administrators do **not** perform Guest or Registered user actions as their role is purely administrative.

### **Business Processes and Use Cases**

#### **Business Processes**

1. **Content Acquisition:** Gathering and verifying raw information on new games including platform availability, genre classifications, and cover images from various sources. This is the initial input process that precedes all administrative data management tasks.

* Image formats limited to common types (JPEG, PNG)  
* No video content support (only static images)  
* No advanced image editing features within the platform  
* Search limited to title and description text matching (no semantic or AI-powered search)

**Scalability Considerations:**

* Performance optimization required for large image catalogs  
* Client-side filtering may become slower with very large datasets  
* Firebase Storage costs scale with image storage volume

### **Key Changes Summary:**

* **Removed Specs attribute** from GAME entity  
* **Added Genre attribute** to GAME entity for game categorization  
* **Added Image attribute** to GAME entity for game cover/thumbnail images  
* Replaced "general search tools" with "search and filtering tools" throughout  
* Added **Filter by Genre** as a key feature and use case  
* Updated functional requirements to include genre filtering and image display capabilities  
* Enhanced multi-criteria filtering to include genre as a filter option  
* **Updated technology stack** to reflect actual implementation (HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS, Node.js, Express.js, Firebase) with Firebase Storage for images  
* **Updated methodology** to include specific technologies, image handling, and development workflow  
* Maintained all review and rating system features  
* **Administrator role strictly limited** to: manage database (including images), monitor consistency, view all user reviews, moderate reviews by removing any user reviews (NO Guest/Registered operations)  
* **Updated entity descriptions** for clarity and completeness  
* **Added Firebase Storage** for cloud-based image management
